tep 1: Read Chapters 8-9 of the Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial, and Complete Related Exercises

There is only a single big step for this assignment: read chapters 8-9 of the Amzi! Adventure in Prolog Tutorial. Links to the individual chapters are on the left side of the screen.

You must complete all of the above exercises. It is recommended to first read a chapter, then complete the exercises for that chapter, as opposed to trying to read in bulk and then complete the exercises in bulk.

While the turnaround time on this assignment is pretty short, this reading should take a proportionally small amount of time.
