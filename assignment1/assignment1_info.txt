Goals for This Assignment

By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:

Write semi-functional code in Python
Implement a basic Boolean evaluator in Python
Implement a basic SAT solver using the semantic tableau technique, in Python

Step-by-Step Instructions

Step 1: Implement an Evaluator of Boolean Expressions

For this assignment, you'll be using Python. While Python is not generally considered a functional language, we will be writing code that is mostly functional in nature. Notably, we will be using immutable linked lists, as well as immutable maps.

Download boolean_evaluator.py. You will need to define a recursive evaluator of Boolean expressions in this file. The comments in the file provide more details.

Step 2: Implement a SAT Solver Based on Semantic Tableau

Download sat_solver.py. You will need to define a SAT solver using the semantic tableau technique. The comments in the file provide more details.
