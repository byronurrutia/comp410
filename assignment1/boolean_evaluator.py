# ---AST Definition---
#
# There are four kinds of expressions:
#
# 1.) True, represented with `True` (Python Boolean literal)
#
# 2.) False, represented with `False` (Python Boolean literal)
#
# 3.) Logical and, which represents an AND operation between
#     two subexpressions.  This is represented with the `And`
#     class, which has `left` and `right` fields for subexpressions.
#
# 4.) Logical or, which represents an OR operation between
#     two subexpressions.  This is represented with the `Or`
#     class, which has `left` and `right` fields for subexpressions.
#
# A more compact representation of all the above information is shown
# below in a variant of a BNF grammar:
#
# e âˆˆ Expression ::= True | False | And(e1, e2) | Or(e1, e2)

# eval_expr
#
# Takes the following:
# 1.) An expression, according to the AST definition above
#
# Returns:
# A Boolean value (either True or False), corresponding to the result of
# evaluating the expression
#
# Purpose:
# Evaluates a Boolean expression down to a Python Boolean value (either True or False)
#
# You need to implement eval_expr.  To this end, the following hints may be helpful:
# 1.) eval_expr needs to be recursive
# 2.) You can use `expression == True` or `expression == False` to see if the expression
#     is directly `True` or `False`
# 3.) You can use `isinstance(expression, And)` or `isinstance(expression, Or)` to see
#     if the expression is an `And` or `Or` AST node.
# 4.) `True` and `False` act as base cases, and these should produce `True` and
#     `False`, respectively
# 5.) For `And` and `Or`, you can use the built-in `and` and `or` operations.
#     These operate on Python Boolean values (either `True` or `False`)
# 6.) You do not need to write a lot of code; my reference solution is 7 lines long.
#     If you start needing a lot more code than that, ask for help to make sure
#     you're still on-track.
